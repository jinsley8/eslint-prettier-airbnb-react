# A script to create a boilerplate ESlint + Prettier + Airbnb Style Guide Configuration for React

## Installation

1. Navigate to your app directory where you want to include this style configuration.

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

2. Run this command inside your app's root directory. Note: this command executes the `eslint-prettier-config.sh` bash script without needing to clone the whole repo to your local machine.

   ```bash
   exec 3<&1;bash <&3 <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinsley8/eslint-prettier-airbnb-react/master/eslint-prettier-config.sh 2> /dev/null)
   ```

3. Make selections for your preference of package manager (npm or yarn), file format (.js or .json), max-line size, and trailing commas (none, es5, all).

4. Look in your project's root directory and notice the two newly added/updated config files:
   - `.eslintrc.js` (or `.eslintrc.json`)
   - `.prettierrc.js` (or `.prettierrc.json`)
